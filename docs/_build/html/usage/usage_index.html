<p>Your Home Page also provides a list of cellular compartments that are nothing less than Gene Ontologies.
Each one of the entries represents a gene list of Entrez Gene IDs and you can select the ones you are more interested in by clicking the “+” button located on the right side of each box.
A search box is also provided to filter the ones you are most interested in.
Gene Ontologies of interest will be added to the other list alongside the preselected ones: Nucleus, Cytoplasm, Mitochondrion, Lysosome, Endoplasmic Reticulum, Golgi Apparatus, Cytoskeleton, Membrane.
You can of course remove them by clicking the “-” button in the selected boxes.
Cellular compartments selected will be found in a dropdown menu after PathLay has completed the analysis and it’s ready to show the results on functional pathways.
Once a cellular compartment is chosen, only genes and proteins localized in that compartment will remain displayed on the pathways (see more “Pathway Explorer”).</p>

<p>PathLay also supports GTRD as a database and can display transcription factors (TFs) that interacts with genes coming from a Transcriptomic or Proteomic dataset and as well recognize if those gene/protein IDs actually refers directly to a transcription factor.
Transcription factors will be loaded and linked to the gene IDs in the Transcriptomic dataset if the “Enable TFs” feature is enabled. The same goes for the proteomic dataset which has its own “Enable TFs” feature.
If a transcription factor is found in the Transcriptomic dataset it will be linked to any related gene also present in the dataset.
Whenever Transcriptomic and Proteomic datasets are enabled together and the “Enable TFs” feature is enabled for at least one of them, once a TF is recognized, its targets will be looked for both in the Transcriptomic and Proteomic dataset to guarantee an high level degree of integration.</p>

<p>It is possible to perform a selection of maps to display in the PathLay - MAPS page by enabling Fisher’s Exact Test for desired datasets.
Maps are selected with a statistical approach based on the Fisher’s Exact Test and since PathLay integrates different datasets, it is also possible to select which dataset will contribute on the map selection.
By default the test is performed on each dataset enabled and it will produce a list of maps considered of importance, all the lists produced are then joined into one.
There are two tweaks available that can change the result of this step: the Intersect option and the Pooling option.</p>

<p>Eabling the Pooling option will affect how the Transcriptomic, Proteomic, miRNomic, Methylomic and Cromatin Status datasets are treated when enabled for the test.
When enabled, the IDs of the above datasets will be merged and the test is performed on that single list.</p>

By default map lists are joined into one, meaning that even if a map has been found relevant in relation to just one of the datasets, it will be kept and indicators will be plotted on it.
With the Intersect feature enabled, only maps that are considered relevant for all the datasets enabled are kept (i.e. the ones that appear in every map list coming from the tests performed).</p>

</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>These sections and the respective features will be explained in detail later.</p>
</section>
<section id="highlighting-feature">
<span id="usage-results-highlight"></span><h3>Highlighting Feature<a class="headerlink" href="#highlighting-feature" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>In this sections two selectors are displayed and their content varies depending on the features enabled during configuration.
The first selector lists the categories of components available between: Genes, Proteins, TFs, miRNAs, Methylations, Chromatin Statuses and Metabolites.
Selecting one data type will switch to the respective component selector filled with the available IDs.
When an ID is chosen, all the indicators related to it will be highlighted with a pink dotted border, and the maps not containing any indicator of interest will be disabled from the map selector.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>To reset the highlight simply select the first option from the ID selector.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The highlight feature will highlight only those indicators currently available from the displayable maps.
This means that when a query from the “Selectors” section has been performed, the selectors in the Highlight section will be filled only with the components represented on the maps that remained available after it.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="the-clipboard">
<span id="usage-results-clipboard"></span><h3>The Clipboard<a class="headerlink" href="#the-clipboard" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The Clipboard is a freely movable window that will be displayed as soon as the “Clipboard” writing is clicked in the menu.
It is composed by two boxes, the “Info” box and the “Selected” box.
The “Info” box will display the information related to a clicked indicator, this includes every ID that the indicator is portaying, with their differential expression values and other IDs eventually linked.
Cliking on the IDs in the “Info” box will open up a page in the online database of reference for that data type:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>NCBI for genes</p></li>
<li><p>UniProtKB for proteins</p></li>
<li><p>Mirtarbase for miRNAs</p></li>
<li><p>gsea-msigdb for TFs.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Once you have clicked an indicator on a pathway and its information is displayed on the Clipboard, you can click the “Add” button below the “Info” box and save the indicator inside the Clipboard’s “Selected” box.
It will be listed as a smaller indicator under the name of the pathway from where the selction has been performed.
Selecting this smaller indicator in the box will also display its information in the “Info” box and if the “Remove” button is clicked, the indicator will be removed from the “Selected” box.
The “Select” button under the “Selected” box on the Clipboard performs the same operations as the highlight button in the Highlight Section, thus applying a dotted magenta border on the indicators of interest and disabling maps not containing them in the map selector.
The last feature provided by the Clipboard is the “Download” button which allows to download a tab separated text document listing all the information regarding selected indicators currently populating the “Selected” box.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Closing the Clipboard by clicking the “X” on the top right corner will not delete any selected indicator from the “Selected” box.</p>

<div class="toctree-wrapper compound">
</div>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>This section contains the main query system of the “PathLay - MAPS” page allowing to perform a more sophisticate three level selection by:</dt><dd><ul class="simple">
<li><p>IDs</p></li>
<li><p>Agreement between two components</p></li>
<li><p>Ontology (Cellular Compartments)</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>These selections can be performed by adding a query tag using one of the three selectors and clicking the respective “Add” button.
Once all the query tags you are interested in are added to the pool on the right, the query can be performed by clicking the “Select” button.</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>A brief summary of the rationale behind the query is the following:</dt><dd><ul class="simple">
<li><p>The IDs provided are rounded up and only those maps that contains indicators representing them are allowed to proceed in the query. Is important to note that this step works with an “AND” approach so, whenever a map does not represent even one of the IDs provided, it is discarded and thus removed from the selector.</p></li>
<li><p>The Agreements provided are rounded up and the indicators that are currently displayable or that passed the previous step of the query, are checked for all the Agreements. Whenever an agreement is not satisfied, the indicator is hidden and if all the indicators in a specific map don’t satisfy the agreements, the map is discarded and removed from the selector.</p></li>
<li><p>The Ontologies provided are rounded up and the indicators that are currently displayable or that passed the previous step of the query, are checked for components that refers to the cellular compartments selected. Whenever an indicator doesn’t refer to one of the compartments selected, it is hidden and if all the indicators in a specific map don’t refer to the cellular compartments, the map is discarded and removed from the map selector.</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>To reset the interface to its default state simply click the “Reset” button next to it.
Details on each type of query tag are provided below.</p>
<section id="select-by-ids">
<span id="usage-results-logical-byids"></span><h4>Select by IDs<a class="headerlink" href="#select-by-ids" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>The first row in the Logical Section is composed by a selector that allows the selection of a data type between “Gene”, “Protein”, TFs, “miRNA”, “Methylation”, “Chromatin” and “Metabolite”, depending on your analysis configuration.
Selecting one data type will pop up another selector with a list of IDs of the data type chosen, in a similar fashion of the HighLight section.
Once an ID is selected, it can be added to the query pool “IDs Selected”.
Every ID added to the pool will be represented as a query tag and can be removed from the pool by clicking the “X” button on the right.
IDs’ query tag have colors are assigned considering the data type:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Light blue for genes</p></li>
<li><p>Purple for proteins</p></li>
<li><p>Red for miRNAs</p></li>
<li><p>Yellow for Metabolites</p></li>
<li><p>Grey for TFs, Methylations and Chromatin Statuses</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The “Select” button will perform a pathway selection using the pool content as criteria: considering a strictly ID based query, only those pathways portraying all the IDs in the pool will be displayed in the pathway selector and kept available.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>It is possible that loaded pathways cannot satisfy the requirements for the selection made. In this case the pathway selector will become empty. Resetting the selection with the “Reset” button will restore the pathway selector at its default state.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="select-by-agreement">
<span id="usage-results-logical-byagreement"></span><h4>Select by Agreement<a class="headerlink" href="#select-by-agreement" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>The second row in the Logical Section is composed by a series of selectors that allows the setup of the so called “Agreement” which is a feature that lets you select two related data types and select what type of correlation you are interested in. The main data type can be selected with the first selector which provides a choice between “Gene” and “Protein”, and the second data type can be selected with the other selector which allows a choice between “Gene” or “Protein” (depending on your main data type of choice), “miRNA”, “Methylation” or “TF”. After the two data types are selected, the last step to do is to choose a “Positive Agreement” or a “Negative Agreement” with the last selector and hit the “Add” button. The configured agreement will be displayed in the “Agreements Selected” pool positioned under the “IDs Selected” pool. Once the select button is clicked, indicators that don’t satisfy the requirements of the agreement will be hidden, thus if a pathway doesn’t have visible indicators it will not be included in the pathway selector. Multiple agreements can be added to the pool to make the selection more stringent. How various agreements work is reported in the following table:</p>
<p>As an example, let’s suppose we want to examine only the indicators including a gene and a miRNA in a positive agreement: it is only necessary to select “Gene”, “miRNA” and “Positive” from the selectors provided in the Logical section. A positive agreement between a gene and a miRNA is based on a negative correlation, so the indicators highlighted will either have an up-regulated gene and a down-regulated miRNA or a down-regulated gene and an up-regulated miRNA. As a next step, we could also be looking at methylations: easily enough, agreement selections can be stacked so we could also select “Gene”, “Methylation”, “Positive” and highlight only those indicators that satisfy both the agreements.
As before, to remove it the “X” button on the right or the “Reset” button must be clicked.</p>
