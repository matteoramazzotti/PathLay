Gene Ontologies
---------------

Your Home Page also provides a list of cellular compartments that are nothing less than Gene Ontologies.
Each one of the entries represents a gene list of Entrez Gene IDs and you can select the ones you are more interested in by clicking the "+" button located on the right side of each box.
A search box is also provided to filter the ones you are most interested in.
Gene Ontologies of interest will be added to the other list alongside the preselected ones: Nucleus, Cytoplasm, Mitochondrion, Lysosome, Endoplasmic Reticulum, Golgi Apparatus, Cytoskeleton, Membrane.
You can of course remove them by clicking the "-" button in the selected boxes.
Cellular compartments selected will be found in a dropdown menu after PathLay has completed the analysis and it's ready to show the results on functional pathways.
Once a cellular compartment is chosen, only genes and proteins localized in that compartment will remain displayed on the pathways (see more "Pathway Explorer").
