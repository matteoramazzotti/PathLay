The "PathLay - MAPS" page will be displayed after the configuration and the submitting of an analysis on an Experiment Package in your home. IDs coming from your datasets will be portrayed as different indicators on pathways depending on the Analysis Mode chosen (see more "Selecting an Analysis Mode"). This page allows you to:

	* Display your datasets on pathways
	* Filter pathways by selecting a specific gene/protein/miRNA/TF ID or by multiple IDs
	* Select a cellular compartment and display only the IDs localized in it
	* Select indicators and display their infos on the clipboard
	* Save indicators of interest and download them as a tab-separated text file
	* Filter pathways by selecting an "Agreement" between Gene/Proteins and Methylation, miRNAs or TFs

.. warning::
	The "PathLay - MAPS" page is directly accessible after you hit the "Submit" button allowing you to navigate through pathways right away but depending on how much data PathLay needs to process, some indicators may not be displayed correctly from the go and require more time.
