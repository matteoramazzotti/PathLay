=================================

   usage_access_filtering
   usage_access_id_only
   tfs/usage_access_tfs






Using the "Select omic" selector you can switch between the filtering configurations available for each dataset.
Some of these configurations are common to every data type, while others, related to the Transcription Factors (TFs) and the Non Differentially Expressed components (NoDE), are peculiar to a few of them.
