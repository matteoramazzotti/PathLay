Configuring Filters for a Dataset
=================================

Using the "Select omic" selector you can switch between the filtering configurations available for each dataset.
Some of these configurations are common to every data type, while others, related to the Transcription Factors (TFs) and the Non Differentially Expressed components (NoDE), are peculiar to a few of them.
