The "Select Maps using" section allows to select the datasets you want to use by simply check the boxes you are interested in between "Genes", "Proteins", "miRNAs", "Methylations", "Chromatin Status" and "Metabolites".

.. warning::
	Whenever a checkbox is disabled, it means that either the dataset was not found available or that the setup in the Home page was not performed accordingly (i.e. the content of the columns was not pointed out correctly).
