Transcription Factors ID Preservation
=====================================

Normally, if a Transcription Factor is recognized in an ID Only component found in the Transcriptomic or Proteomic dataset (when of course the "Preserve non DE IDs" feature is enabled for them), it is just loaded as a DE component and not represented as a TF.
To overcome this, one should enable the "Preserve IDs for TFs" feature in the Gene or Protein configuration depending on the scope of the analysis.
Transcription Factors recognized in this manner will be represented as small oragne squares on the right side of the main indicators.
