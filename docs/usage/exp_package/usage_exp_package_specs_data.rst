^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each dataset file (i.e. a file with .mrna, .prot, .mirna, .meta, .meth and .chroma extension) is a tab separated file that can have any number of columns but at least one, two or three, depending on the Analysis configuration you will choose for PathLay (see more in Configuration Page section), the only mandatory field is the one containing the IDs.

.. note::
	Datasets can be copied and pasted in their related text areas in your Home Page. Once the "Save" button is clicked the dataset file will be created in your home folder and named after the experiment.
