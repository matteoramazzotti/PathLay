Intersect
---------

Enabling the Intersect option will affect which maps will be selected after the test has been performed. 
By default map lists are joined into one, meaning that even if a map has been found relevant in relation to just one of the datasets, it will be kept and indicators will be plotted on it.
With the Intersect feature enabled, only maps that are considered relevant for all the datasets enabled are kept (i.e. the ones that appear in every map list coming from the tests performed).
