Alternative installation
------------------------

If the online databases are not responding due to technical issues or the configuration page doesnâ€™t function as expected, you can manually install the required data. We have provided a GitHub repository with a pre-configured database.

To use this alternative:

	#.	Access the repository `here <https://github.com/lorenzocasbarra/pathlay-dbs>`_.
	#.	Download the pathlay_data folder.
	#.	Overwrite the pathlay_data folder on your system with the one from the repository.
