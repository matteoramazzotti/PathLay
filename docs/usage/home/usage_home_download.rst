^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The "Download" button allows you to package the currently loaded datasets and configurations in a zip archive and export it from PathLay for other uses, for instance, this archive can be uploaded as a new Experiment Package into another PathLay account.
You can also download the entirety of your home folder (i.e. all the datasets and configurations of all the experiments) with the "Download Home" button.
