Highlighting Feature
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this sections two selectors are displayed and their content varies depending on the features enabled during configuration.
The first selector lists the categories of components available between: Genes, Proteins, TFs, miRNAs, Methylations, Chromatin Statuses and Metabolites.
Selecting one data type will switch to the respective component selector filled with the available IDs.
When an ID is chosen, all the indicators related to it will be highlighted with a pink dotted border, and the maps not containing any indicator of interest will be disabled from the map selector.


.. note::
	To reset the highlight simply select the first option from the ID selector.

.. note::
	The highlight feature will highlight only those indicators currently available from the displayable maps. 
	This means that when a query from the "Selectors" section has been performed, the selectors in the Highlight section will be filled only with the components represented on the maps that remained available after it.
